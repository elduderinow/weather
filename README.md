# The weather app

## Practical Information

* Repository: `weather`
* Demo: http://weather.yarrut.com/

## What is the weather app?
This weather app displays the weather of your desired location based on city AND country (because there are several cities in the world who share the same name). Plus a 5 day forecast.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to learn to handle fetch API data and manipulate DOM elements.

## FUNCTIONALITIES
- query on city and country
- show current info + 5 day forecast
- on page load, it the background is each time a random nature (outside) image from a country.
- on query the background changes to the locations image.
- smooth animations
- custom icons for weather forecast

## THE PROJECT
It was a fun project, super good to learn or to train fetching API's and manipulate the information in the objects. 
Would add a lot more functionalities, but had no time because I wanted to do both of the excercies. 
I however put my effort in both of them as good as possible.
